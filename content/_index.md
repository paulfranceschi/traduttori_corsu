This site presents my work in philosophy. It contains published articles and preprints. The texts relate to analytic philosophy, ontology, the study of concepts, cognition and psycho-pathological philosophy.

My work is primarily concerned with analytic philosophy and consists of proposed solutions to some philosophical paradoxes : the Doomsday argument, Hempel's paradox, Goodman 's paradox, the surprise examination paradox, the Sleeping Beauty problem, the Black-Leslie paradox of the spheres, the Simulation argument, etc.. A conceptual tool, the n-universes, which are useful for the study of philosophical problems is also presented.

An important area of interest is the study of reasoning in the field of psychopathology. Several texts also relate to cognition and cognitive distortions. Additions to the classical theory of cognitive distortions are exposed, and their applications in the field of psycho-pathological philosophy: a new conceptual framework for cognitive distortions, a specific account of personalization, and of over-generalization and labelling.

Lastly, there are texts on semantics and the study of concepts. These texts are based on a specific conceptual tool : the matrices of concepts. Recent applications to the dialectical plan, to paradigm analysis of a corpus of proverbs , to the analysis of the love-hate indifference triplet of concepts are also presented.

My work involves some fields that are apparently very different. However, most texts are underpinned by a particular philosophical doctrine , which can be defined as "dialectical contextualism". And this doctrine has applications in analytical philosophy, psycho-pathological philosophy and the study of concepts. Its role as a methodological tool aimed at solving philosophical paradoxes is explained in more detail in my "Elements of dialectical contextualism".
